    *   The .deb archive is created using code in your current repository.
        It does not use cpan2deb to pull CPAN code to create the .deb
        archive.

    *   You must have dh-make-perl installed on your system to use this
        command.

    *   use sudo apt-get install dh-make-perl to install it on debian and
        ubuntu.

    *   The .deb file will be created in the debuild folder, This should be
        added to your .gitignore file.
